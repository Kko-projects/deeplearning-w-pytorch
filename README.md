# Deep Learning with PyTorch üß†üî•

This project is a curated collection of PyTorch-based deep learning experiments and implementations.  
It covers fundamental operations as well as model training pipelines on datasets like MNIST and CIFAR-10.  
Models include fully-connected networks (MLP), convolutional networks (VGG, ResNet18), and efficient architectures like MobileNetV2.


### üß† Core Concepts
- 01 ~ 04

### üî¢ Classification Models
- 05 ~ 08
- 09: Transfer learning with pretrained models (VGG16)

### üñºÔ∏è Object Detection Experiments
This section contains object detection experiments using pre-trained models such as:

- 10: NVIDIA SSD (Single Shot Multibox Detector)
- üîú YOLOv5 (Coming soon)
- üîú Faster R-CNN (Coming soon)

## üóÇ Datasets

This project uses:
- **MNIST**: 28x28 grayscale digits for basic classification tasks.
- **CIFAR-10**: 32x32 RGB images from 10 categories (e.g., airplane, cat, truck).
- **Flowers Dataset (from Udacity)**: ~4,000 color images in 5 classes: `daisy`, `dandelion`, `roses`, `sunflowers`, and `tulips`.

All datasets are automatically downloaded via `torchvision.datasets`.
